# EaglePoint Learning Management System API

Monolithic Laravel 11 API backend for learner management, enrollment workflows, scheduling/booking, location services, security training, and audit/reporting. Designed for single-machine Docker deployment with no external service dependencies.

## Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose
- No local PHP or Composer installation required

## Quick Start

```bash
# Optional: create .env from the example (the app entrypoint does this automatically
# if .env is missing and .env.example exists)
# cp .env.example .env

# Build and start services (app, webserver, mysql). The app container runs
# composer install on boot, generates APP_KEY if missing, runs migrations, and
# seeds roles/permissions when the roles table is empty (set AUTORUN_MIGRATIONS=0
# or AUTORUN_SEED=0 to skip those steps).
docker compose up -d --build

# Verify the application is running
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok"}
```

Use the **`app`** service for Composer or Artisan (not `webserver`). Example: `docker compose exec app php artisan …`.

If you change the Dockerfile, rebuild with `docker compose up -d --build`.

## Docker Services

| Service   | Container            | Port            | Description             |
| --------- | -------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------- |
| app       | eaglepoint-app       | 9000 (internal) | PHP 8.2-FPM application |
| webserver | eaglepoint-webserver | 8000            | Nginx reverse proxy     |
| mysql     | eaglepoint-mysql     | 3306            | MySQL 8.0 database      |

### Useful Docker Commands

```bash
# View logs
docker compose logs -f app

# Open a shell in the app container
docker compose exec app bash

# Run artisan commands
docker compose exec app php artisan <command>

# Stop all services
docker compose down

# Rebuild after Dockerfile changes
docker compose up -d --build
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run the full test suite (auto-detects Docker, starts services if needed)
./run_tests.sh

# Or run explicitly inside a running container
docker compose exec app bash run_tests.sh

# Run only PHPUnit tests
docker compose exec app php artisan test

# Run specific test suites
docker compose exec app php vendor/bin/phpunit unit_tests/
docker compose exec app php vendor/bin/phpunit API_tests/

# Run a single test file
docker compose exec app php vendor/bin/phpunit unit_tests/DataNormalizationTest.php
```

`./run_tests.sh` works both locally and in CI. When run outside Docker it detects `docker compose` (with fallback to `docker-compose`), ensures services are up, and executes tests inside the app container automatically.

### Test Suite Summary

| Suite       | Location      | Tests | Covers                                                                                                             |
| ----------- | ------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Custom Unit | `unit_tests/` | 94    | Normalization, deduplication, enrollment states, booking rules, audit chaining, encryption/masking, geofencing     |
| Custom API  | `API_tests/`  | 49    | Auth, permissions, learner CRUD/import, enrollment workflow, booking conflicts, location disclosure, report export |

## Verification Checklist

1. **Start the application**

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   # .env is created from .env.example on first boot if missing
   ```

2. **Verify health endpoint**

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
   # Expected: {"status":"ok"}
   ```

3. **Run all tests**

   ```bash
   ./run_tests.sh
   # Expected: ALL PASSED with 154 tests
   ```

4. **Test authentication flow**

   ```bash
   # Login
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"username":"admin","password":"YourPassword1!"}'

   # Use the returned token for subsequent requests
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/auth/me \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
   ```

5. **Verify role-based access**
   - Admin can access all endpoints
   - Field agent cannot access `/api/import/learners` (403)
   - Field agent sees obfuscated coordinates on location endpoints
